# Kanban Board

## Ideas

- Find a better screenshot application for Mac.
- Add Audio as a examples when possible.
- Add wow to connect virtual MIDI ports to Pure Data.
- Plot waveforms and spectrograms of audio files using Python.
- Add a section on using Pure Data with Python.

## To do

###

#### General

- Think and Add more creative examples and exercises in synthesis chapter.
- Add image captions.
- Reference images from internet or with third-party owners.
- Create a better cover image for the book.

#### Sequencers

- Transcribe Python code examples to Pure Data.
- Add audio samples.
- Download all images from the internet and add them to the book.
  - or use a python script to generate them.
- 

#### Synthesis

- Add link to each pd example.
- See Campus --> Add art works reference to synthesis chapter (oscillators, additive, subtractive, modulation).
- - Add Risset's bell on the additivity synthesis section.
- Add Poem for 100 metronomes and explain dinamic patching.
- Summary of the [Phil Niblock paper](https://www.straebel.com/files/Straebel%202008_Niblock.pdf)

#### Play and Rec

- Add Arrays and Tables.
- Intro and review basic concepts of readsf and writesf~ in
