## To do

- Check note / important block comments
- Check Mermaid diagrams legibility
- make Game of Life in Pure Data (take reference from the current Python version)
- Check Creative Aplications section. Sometimes are quite long. Don't sell smoke!
  - Some code examples don't have Creative application section. Check it.
- Check and change chapter's name in index.qmd book map.

###

#### General

  - b. Write a pd external in C.
