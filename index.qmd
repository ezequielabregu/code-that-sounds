# Preface

The goal of this book is to provide a comprehensive guide to creative coding using Pure Data (Pd). The book will cover various aspects of Pd, including sound synthesis, data visualization, and interactive installations.
The content will be structured into chapters, each focusing on a specific topic or project. The chapters will include code examples, explanations, and visualizations to help readers understand the concepts and techniques used in PD.

## What are you going to learn?

In this book, you will learn how to use Pure Data to create interactive audio-visual projects. You will explore various techniques for sound synthesis, data visualization, and interactive installations. The book will also cover best practices for organizing and managing your Pd projects, as well as tips for debugging and optimizing your code.

## Who is this book for?

This book is intended for anyone interested in learning about creative coding using Pure Data. It is suitable for beginners who are new to programming and want to explore the world of interactive media, as well as for experienced programmers looking to expand their skills in sound synthesis and data visualization.

## What are you don't going to learn?

This book is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all aspects of Pure Data. Instead, it focuses on specific topics and projects that are relevant to creative coding. While the book will cover a wide range of techniques and concepts, it will not delve into every detail or aspect of Pure Data.
This book is not a substitute for the official Pure Data documentation or other resources. It is meant to complement these resources and provide a practical, hands-on approach to learning Pure Data.

## Pre-requisites

To get the most out of this book, you should have a basic understanding of programming and some familiarity with the Pure Data language. 

If you are new to Pure Data or programming, there are several free online resources that can help you get started:

- [Pure Data FLOSS Manual](http://floss.booktype.pro/pure-data/introduction2/) – A beginner-friendly and comprehensive guide to Pure Data.
- [Official Pure Data Documentation](https://msp.ucsd.edu/Pd_documentation/index.htm) – The official manuals and reference materials for Pure Data.
- [Miller Puckette's "Theory and Techniques of Electronic Music"](https://msp.ucsd.edu/techniques/latest/book.pdf) – A comprehensive book by the creator of Pure Data, covering both theory and practical techniques.

These resources can be consulted before or alongside this book to strengthen your foundational knowledge.
