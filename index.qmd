# Preface {.unnumbered}

This book was born out of the classroom—but it does not stay there. It is the result of years of teaching creative coding and interactive media at public universities, engaging with students from a wide range of disciplines, backgrounds, and interests. Over time, a common thread emerged: the desire to bridge artistic expression and technical skill, to write code not just as a means to an end, but as a space of exploration, experimentation, and play.

In these pages, you’ll find the distilled insights, exercises, and creative strategies that have shaped countless workshops and academic programs. The goal has always been twofold: to equip readers with the tools to build interactive digital systems, and to nurture a mindset where sound, movement, code, and structure can be explored as artistic materials. Whether it's a generative soundscape, a data-driven artwork, or a custom tool built from scratch, the projects in this book are designed to foster technical growth while encouraging individual expression.

This is not a manual in the traditional sense, nor is it a fixed curriculum. Instead, this book invites you to engage with Pure Data on your own terms, navigating its chapters in whatever order best suits your curiosity. The modular structure is intentional: it supports creative detours, sudden insights, and unexpected connections between ideas. You are encouraged to experiment, remix, and stretch the boundaries of the examples presented. Treat the book as both a guide and a sandbox—one where art, sound, code, and interactivity come alive through your engagement.

Whether you're an artist exploring new tools, a programmer seeking creative outlets, or a student diving into the world of interactive media, I hope this book helps you discover how code can become a language for imagination.

## Who am I?

My name is **Ezequiel Abregú**, and I am a sound artist, composer, multi-instrumentalist, and researcher originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina. My artistic practice encompasses sound recordings, audio installations, performances, sound sculptures, sound design, and compositions for chamber music, choreography, and theater. I am particularly interested in the interplay between music, performance, sound art, live electronics, auditory and visual perception, interactive media, and the application of technology in art.

I hold a Ph.D. focusing on the relationship between visual and auditory perception in sound art, and a degree in Composition with Electroacoustic Media from the National University of Quilmes (UNQ). My academic career includes teaching positions at several institutions: I am a professor at the University of Quilmes (Computing Applied to Music area), the National University of Arts (Multimedia Arts area), and the University of Tres de Febrero (Electronic Arts area).

My passion for programming and digital audio applications has led me to explore various programming languages and tools over the past two decades, including C, C++, Python, and Pure Data. I am an advocate of the open-source philosophy, regularly working with Linux and sharing my projects in publicly accessible repositories. My technical expertise extends to hardware development using microcontrollers and single-board computers, enabling me to adopt a hands-on approach in both my artistic and research endeavors.

## What is this book about?

The goal of this book is to support undergraduate and postgraduate students in exploring the intersection of creativity and technology alongside peers from diverse backgrounds. Building on years of teaching experience at several public universities[^1], this work encourages the integration of a creative mindset with programming skills to design original tools, algorithms, and artworks. Through this synthesis, the book invites students to engage with sound, interactivity, and control protocols in both technical and expressive dimensions.

Rather than offering a fixed, linear progression, the structure of this book is deliberately open and modular. Readers are encouraged to navigate the content according to their interests, needs, or curiosity. This flexibility supports an experimental approach to learning, where exploration and play are not only welcome but essential.

By approaching programming as a creative practice, this book invites you to think, make, and reflect through code. Whether you're building an interactive sound installation, prototyping a digital instrument, or simply experimenting with new ideas, the goal is to empower you with the tools and concepts to express yourself in the digital domain—and to enjoy the process along the way.

## Who is this book for?

This book is intended for anyone interested in learning about creative coding using Pure Data. It is suitable for beginners who are new to programming and want to explore the world of interactive media, as well as for experienced programmers looking to expand their skills in sound synthesis and data visualization.

## What are you going to learn?

In this book, you will learn how to use Pure Data to create interactive audio-visual projects. You will explore various techniques for sound synthesis, data visualization, and interactive installations. The book will also cover best practices for organizing and managing your Pd projects, as well as tips for debugging and optimizing your code.

## What are you don't going to learn?

This book is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to all aspects of Pure Data. Instead, it focuses on specific topics and projects that are relevant to creative coding. While the book will cover a wide range of techniques and concepts, it will not delve into every detail or aspect of Pure Data. This book is not a substitute for the official Pure Data documentation or other resources. It is meant to complement these resources and provide a practical, hands-on approach to learning Pure Data.

## A Work in Progress

Before we delve deeper into the subject, let it be clear from the outset: 

::: {style="text-align:center;"}
> **This book is, by design, a work in progress.**
:::

The intention is not to present a definitive compendium or a closed collection of recipes. Instead, what I offer here is a growing body of materials, case studies, and conceptual tools that evolve in parallel with the creative and technical challenges faced by artists and researchers working at the intersection of code, sound, and interactivity. The choice of Pure Data as the primary platform reflects both its openness and its suitability for rapid prototyping and conceptual clarity. But beyond that, this book aims to serve as a *framework for thinking*, not just for coding.


## From Problem to Algorithm

One of the central ideas guiding this book is that programming begins with a problem, not with a tool. In each chapter and example, we begin by carefully defining a problem: this might be technical (how to generate a sequence?), aesthetic (how to modulate a tone?), or conceptual (how do oscillators shape our understanding of time?). From there, we proceed to *analyze* the problem, understand its inner structure, and design an algorithmic strategy to address it. 

Only then do we concern ourselves with the details of implementation. The choice of programming language—Pure Data in this case—is important, but always secondary. The clarity of thought and the logic of the algorithm come first. In this spirit, we encourage you to reflect not just on *what* a patch does, but on *why* it works the way it does, and *how* it might be extended, modified, or reimagined.

## Backend First: Leaving the GUI for Later

Another important methodological decision in this book is our emphasis on the **backend**. We begin by focusing on signal flow, algorithmic thinking, and control structures—those components that shape the inner workings of a patch. In many cases, the graphical interface (GUI) can be a distraction from the deeper mechanics at play.

By concentrating first on backend logic, we build a strong foundation that can later support more refined user interactions. GUI design will certainly be addressed, but in future chapters, when we are equipped with a clearer understanding of how our systems behave and how we want them to evolve. In other words, we treat the visual layer as a representation of logic, not a replacement for it.

This book is an invitation to approach creative coding not as a set of shortcuts or pre-made solutions, but as a *process of inquiry*. We will get our hands dirty, make mistakes, and revise along the way. In doing so, we learn not just how to build systems, but how to think with and through them. That is the deeper promise of creative code.
