# Introduction

Traditionally, the process of creating software applications has relied heavily on text-based programming languages. Developers would write code manually in text files and execute them later to observe the outcome. While this method is efficient for those trained in programming, it often presents a steep learning curve for artists, musicians, and other creatives without a technical background. The abstract nature of text-based coding can act as a barrier to entry, especially for those more accustomed to working in visual or tactile media.

Pure Data offers a radically different approach by introducing a graphical programming environment tailored to creative exploration. Instead of writing lines of code, users work with visual representations of functions—called objects—that are placed and connected on a canvas. This paradigm allows users to construct interactive programs, known as "patches," by literally drawing connections between elements. Each object can receive messages that modify its behavior in real time, creating a highly responsive and accessible system for building audio, visual, or multimedia tools.

The design of Pure Data echoes the modular synthesis systems of the 20th century, where sound was shaped by routing audio through a network of physical devices linked with patch cables. This historical reference not only grounds Pure Data in a legacy of experimental electronic music but also makes it intuitive for users familiar with analog workflows. By visually "patching" connections, users can simulate and extend these traditional processes in a digital context.

To fully engage with the creative potential of Pure Data, one can develop or modify algorithms for digital audio using imaginative coding strategies. For instance, building a real-time audio granulator that reinterprets live microphone input can offer both technical challenge and artistic reward. Through this lens, programming becomes a form of creative expression, blending logical structures with aesthetic decisions. By experimenting with signal flow, modulation techniques, or interactive sensors, users cultivate a mindset that is both inventive and analytical—unlocking new possibilities in digital sound design and performance.
  
## What is Pure Data?

Pure Data (or Pd) is a real-time graphical programming environment for audio, video, and graphical processing. Pd is commonly used for live music performance, VeeJaying, sound effects, composition, audio analysis, interfacing with sensors, using cameras, controlling robots or even interacting with websites.  Because all of these various media are handled as digital data within the program, many fascinating opportunities for cross-synthesis between them exist. Sound can be used to manipulate video, which could then be streamed over the internet to another computer which might analyze that video and use it to control a motor-driven installation.

Programming with Pd is a unique interaction that is much closer to the experience of manipulating things in the physical world.  The most basic unit of functionality is a box, and the program is formed by connecting these boxes together into diagrams that both represent the flow of data while actually performing the operations mapped out in the diagram.  The program itself is always running, there is no separation between writing the program and running the program, and each action takes effect the moment it is completed.

The community of users and programmers around Pd have created additional functions (called "externals" or "external libraries") which are used for a wide variety of other purposes, such as video processing, the playback and streaming of MP3s or Quicktime video, the manipulation and display of 3-dimensional objects and the modeling of virtual physical objects. There is a wide range of external libraries available which give Pd additional features. Just about any kind of programming is feasible using Pd as long as there are externals libraries which provide the most basic units of functionality required.

The core of Pd written and maintained by [Miller S. Puckette](http://crca.ucsd.edu/~msp/) and includes the work of [many developers](http://www.puredata.org/), making the whole package very much a community effort. 

## Why Pd?

Pd  is a powerful, open-source environment for creative coding, offering a uniquely visual approach to programming that is especially suited for artists, musicians, and interactive media designers. Its intuitive interface and modular structure make it a flexible and accessible tool for developing real-time audio and visual projects—from live performances to experimental installations.

One of Pd’s standout features is its **graphical programming interface**, which replaces traditional lines of code with visual objects and patch cords. This allows users to construct complex behaviors by connecting elements on screen, making it easier to prototype and refine creative ideas. **Real-time processing** capabilities mean that audio and visual data can be generated, modified, and responded to instantly—ideal for performances, generative art, or interactive systems that react to sensors or user input.

Beyond its creative potential, Pd offers practical advantages: it is **cross-platform**, running on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and integrates easily with tools like **Arduino**, **Raspberry Pi**, and **Max/MSP**, enabling hybrid systems that combine digital and physical components. A rich ecosystem of **external libraries** supports advanced functions like synthesis, visualization, and computer vision. Its **open-source nature** encourages exploration and collaboration, with a supportive community, extensive documentation, and countless tutorials available. Because it’s **free and widely used in education**, Pd is not only an effective tool for artistic expression but also a valuable learning resource for developing a strong foundation in programming and multimedia design.

## What is Creative Coding?

Creative coding is the practice of using programming as a tool for artistic expression. It transforms code from a purely functional medium into a creative one, enabling the development of visual art, music, interactive experiences, and experimental media. This approach encourages artists, designers, and technologists to explore beyond the limits of traditional art forms, embracing code as a flexible and dynamic means of invention and communication.

The applications of creative coding are diverse, ranging from generative visuals and algorithmic design to responsive installations and live audiovisual performances. Creators often use languages and environments specifically designed to support creative work, such as Processing, OpenFrameworks, Max/MSP, and Pd. These platforms make it easier to manipulate data, control media in real time, and experiment with unconventional interfaces and outputs.

Importantly, creative coding transcends the boundaries of specific disciplines. It can intersect with visual art, music, dance, theater, architecture, and even narrative writing. What unites these practices is the use of code as an expressive tool—one that invites innovation, play, and conceptual exploration. Closely tied to the values of the open-source movement, creative coding thrives in a culture of sharing, where artists and developers freely exchange code, tutorials, and ideas. This collaborative ecosystem fosters continuous learning and reinvention, empowering creators to expand what is possible through digital technology.

### Installing Externals

Pd's functionality can be extended through the use of **externals**—additional libraries that provide new objects and features. These externals are created by the Pd community and can add everything from new audio effects to advanced data processing tools. Installing externals is straightforward thanks to Pd’s built-in package manager.

#### 1. Open Pd

- Launch Pd  on your computer.
- Make sure you are using the **Vanilla** version for best compatibility with the package manager.

#### 2. Access the "Find Externals" Tool

- In the Pd menu, go to **Help → Find Externals...**  
  This opens the Deken package manager, which allows you to search for and install externals directly from within Pd.

#### 3. Search for an External

- In the search bar, type the name of the external or library you want to install (for example, `zexy`, `cyclone`, or `iemlib`).
- Press **Enter** or click the **Search** button.
- A list of matching externals will appear, showing available versions for your platform.

#### 4. Install the External

- Click on the desired external in the list.
- Choose the version that matches your operating system and Pd version.
- Click **Install**.
- The external will be downloaded and placed in your Pd externals folder (typically `~/Documents/Pd/externals` on macOS and Linux, or `C:\Users\<YourName>\Documents\Pd\externals` on Windows).

#### 5. Add the External to Your Pd Path (if needed)

- Most externals are automatically available after installation.
- If Pd cannot find the external, you may need to add its folder to Pd’s search path:
  - Go to **Preferences → Path...**
  - Click **New** and add the path to the external’s folder (for example, `~/Documents/Pd/externals/cyclone`).
  - Click **OK** and restart Pd.

#### 6. Use the External in Your Patch

- In your patch, create an object with the name of the external’s library, followed by the object you want to use.  
  For example, to use the `counter` object from the `cyclone` library:
  ```
  [cyclone/counter]
  ```
- Some libraries require you to load them with a special object, such as `[declare -lib cyclone]` at the top of your patch.

#### 7. Verify Installation

- If the object appears without errors (no red box), the external is installed correctly.
- If you see errors, double-check the installation path and that you are using the correct object/library name.

#### Manual Installation (Advanced)

If you need to install an external manually:

- Download the external from [https://deken.puredata.info/](https://deken.puredata.info/) or the developer’s website.
- Extract the files to your Pd externals folder.
- Add the folder to Pd’s path as described above.

> **Tip:** Always check the documentation for each external, as installation steps or requirements may vary.

For more details, see the [official Pd documentation on externals](https://msp.ucsd.edu/Pd_documentation/resources/chapter4.htm).

### Setting Up a Virtual MIDI Bus

Establishing a virtual MIDI bus allows MIDI messages to be routed between different applications on the same computer, or to create intricate internal MIDI configurations within applications. This setup is particularly useful for integrating software instruments, sequencers, or custom-built Pd patches into a single ecosystem, enabling real-time interaction across programs.

#### macOS

macOS provides a native solution for virtual MIDI routing through the **IAC Bus** (Inter-Application Communication Bus), a built-in MIDI driver that allows you to create multiple virtual MIDI ports.

To enable and configure the IAC Bus:

1. Open the **Audio MIDI Setup** application (found in `/Applications/Utilities`), then select **Window → Show MIDI Studio** from the top menu.

2. In the **MIDI Studio** window, double-click the **IAC Driver** icon to open its configuration panel.

3. Enable the virtual bus by checking **Device is online**. This activates the driver.

4. You may rename the default port if desired, for better identification in your DAW or software environment.

5. To add additional virtual MIDI ports, click the **+** button. Each new bus functions as a separate virtual cable and can be independently addressed.

Once activated, these ports will appear as MIDI input and output options within your software (e.g., Pd, Live, Max), supporting the full range of MIDI messages including **Note**, **Control Change**, and **MIDI Sync**.

#### Windows

Unlike macOS, Windows does not include a built-in virtual MIDI bus. However, several reliable third-party tools are freely available:

- [**loopMIDI**](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html), developed by Tobias Erichsen, provides a robust solution for creating virtual MIDI ports and supports multiple concurrent buses. It is compatible with both 32-bit and 64-bit systems and is widely recommended for use with modern DAWs and programming environments.

- [**MIDI Yoke**](http://www.midiox.com/) is a legacy solution bundled with MIDI-OX, offering basic virtual MIDI routing. However, MIDI Yoke is **32-bit only**, and therefore **not compatible with 64-bit software**, including Live 10 and later. Use with caution and only in legacy setups.

When setting up virtual MIDI buses in Windows, ensure that your audio software and any MIDI-routing utilities are operating with compatible bit-depths and permissions. Proper driver installation and restart may be necessary to expose the new virtual ports in your system’s MIDI routing options.

Virtual MIDI buses are essential tools for building interactive sound systems, enabling communication between modular audio software, DAWs, and real-time instruments. Whether you are sending MIDI from Pd to a DAW, or routing control signals between applications, setting up a virtual MIDI infrastructure is a crucial foundational step.
