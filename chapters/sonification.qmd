# Sonification

In this chapter, we will explore the concept of sonification, its applications, and how it can be implemented using Pure Data (Pd). We will also discuss the importance of understanding data types and classifications in the context of sonification.

## Introduction
Imagine hearing the changes in global temperature over the past thousand years. What does a brainwave sound like? How can sound be used to enhance a pilot’s performance in the cockpit? These intriguing questions, among many others, fall within the realm of **auditory display** and **sonification**.

Researchers in Auditory Display explore how the human auditory system can serve as a primary interface channel for communicating and conveying information. The goal of auditory display is to foster a deeper understanding or appreciation of the patterns and structures embedded in data beyond what is visible on the screen. 

Auditory display encompasses all aspects of human-computer interaction systems, including the hardware setup (speakers or headphones), modes of interaction with the display system, and any technical solutions for data collection, processing, and computation needed to generate sound in response to data. 

In contrast, **sonification** is a core technique within auditory display: the process of rendering sound from data and interactions. Unlike voice interfaces or artistic soundscapes, auditory displays have gained increasing attention in recent years and are becoming a standard method alongside visualization for presenting data across diverse contexts.

The international research effort to understand every aspect of auditory display began with the founding of the **International Community for Auditory Display (ICAD)** in 1992. It is fascinating to observe how sonification and auditory display techniques have evolved in the relatively short time since their formal definition, with development accelerating steadily since 2011.

Auditory display and sonification are now employed across a wide range of fields. Applications include chaos theory, biomedicine, interfaces for visually impaired users, data mining, seismology, desktop and mobile computing interaction, among many others. 

Equally diverse is the set of research disciplines required for successful sonification: physics, acoustics, psychoacoustics, perceptual research, sound engineering, and computer science form the core technical foundations. However, psychology, musicology, cognitive science, linguistics, pedagogy, social sciences, and philosophy are also essential for a comprehensive, multifaceted understanding of the description, technical implementation, usage, training, comprehension, acceptance, evaluation, and ergonomics of auditory displays and sonification in particular.

It is clear that in such an interdisciplinary field, a narrow focus on any single discipline risks “seeing the trees but missing the forest.” As with all interdisciplinary research efforts, auditory display and sonification face significant challenges, ranging from differing theoretical orientations across fields to even the very vocabulary used to describe our work. 

Interdisciplinary dialogue is crucial to advancing auditory display and sonification. However, the field must overcome the challenge of developing and employing a shared language that integrates many divergent disciplinary ways of speaking, thinking, and approaching problems. On the other hand, this very challenge often unlocks great creative potential and new ideas, as these varied perspectives can spark innovation and fresh insights.


## Data Types

In the realm of digital data, understanding the nature and classification of data types is essential for their effective processing, storage, and analysis. The table above presents a detailed taxonomy of data types broadly categorized into **Static** and **Stream / Realtime** data, further subdivided into various subtypes. This section will unpack these classifications, elaborating on their characteristics, common formats, and sources.

### Static Data

Static data refers to data that is stored and remains unchanged until explicitly modified. It is typically collected, stored, and then analyzed or processed offline or asynchronously. This type of data is fundamental in many computational tasks, including machine learning, data mining, and archival storage.

#### Structured Data

Structured data is organized in a predefined manner, typically conforming to a schema or model that allows easy querying and manipulation.

**Examples:**

* **Datasets (CSV, XLS):** Tabular data with rows and columns, where each column has a defined datatype (e.g., numeric, string, datetime).
* **Fields:** The basic elements of structured data that have specific data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, text strings, or timestamps.
* **Classes:** Labels used in supervised learning, often binary (two classes) or multiclass (multiple categories).
* **Images:** Digital images can be structured if stored with metadata or standardized file formats. Examples include compressed formats like JPG and uncompressed formats like BMP.
* **MIDI Files:** Musical Instrument Digital Interface files encode structured note and control information.
* **Audio:** Raw waveforms or extracted descriptors (e.g., Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients - MFCCs, Fourier transforms) represent audio signals in structured formats.
* **Audio Formats:** Common audio file formats such as MP3 (compressed), FLAC (lossless compressed), and WAV (uncompressed).

**Sources:** Data portals (e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository), social media platforms like Instagram, Reddit, Flickr (for images), and audio repositories.



#### Semi-structured Data

Semi-structured data does not conform to a rigid schema like structured data but still contains tags or markers to separate semantic elements.

**Examples:**

* **Markup Languages:** HTML, XML, JSON, and YAML files are examples of semi-structured data because they contain hierarchical tags and attributes describing the data, but the content may be variable.

**Sources:** Web content, APIs that deliver data in JSON or XML formats.


#### Unstructured Data

Unstructured data lacks a predefined data model or schema. It is the most common form of data generated and can be more challenging to analyze without preprocessing.

**Examples:**

* **Texts:** Documents, emails, articles, or social media posts are typical unstructured data examples.

**Sources:** Document collections, text corpora, email archives.


### Stream / Realtime Data

Stream or realtime data refers to continuous data generated in real-time, often requiring immediate or near-immediate processing. These data types are crucial in applications like live monitoring, interactive systems, and real-time analytics.

**Examples:**

* **Audio Streams:** Continuous audio feeds such as online radio broadcasts.
* **Video Streams:** Live video feeds from CCTV cameras or autonomous vehicles.
* **Sensor Data:** Real-time telemetry or environmental data from IoT devices, Arduino boards, or embedded systems.
* **Live MIDI:** Streaming musical performance data, used in live concerts or interactive installations.
* **OSC (Open Sound Control):** A protocol used for networking sound synthesizers, computers, and other multimedia devices, enabling real-time control.

**Sources:** Online radio platforms, surveillance systems, smart vehicles, embedded IoT devices, live music performance setups.


### Data Classification

The classification of data into **static** and **stream/realtime** reflects fundamentally different operational paradigms in digital systems. Static data often allows batch processing, archival, and complex analysis without stringent timing constraints. In contrast, stream data demands continuous, low-latency processing to support live feedback, monitoring, or interaction.

The **structured / semi-structured / unstructured** distinction highlights the complexity of dealing with data formats:

* **Structured data** is well-suited for traditional databases and straightforward analysis.
* **Semi-structured data** requires flexible parsers and understanding of nested or tagged data.
* **Unstructured data** often necessitates advanced techniques such as natural language processing or computer vision for meaningful extraction.

Understanding these data types and their sources is critical when designing systems for data ingestion, storage, processing, and analysis — especially in fields such as machine learning, multimedia processing, and IoT applications.

## Sonification as a Creative Framework

Sonification, traditionally defined as the systematic, objective, and reproducible translation of data into sound, finds itself at a dynamic intersection between scientific inquiry and creative expression. While often framed within the methodological rigor of data representation, its deeper potential lies equally in its artistic embodiment—an expressive convergence of logic, perception, and auditory imagination. This duality is vital when considering the use of software in the development of creative code practices for sonification. In its essence, sonification provides a means to explore and interpret data temporally. It transforms static information into dynamic sonic experiences, revealing patterns not just to the analytical mind but to the aesthetic ear. As Gresham-Lancaster [@greshamlancaster2012] argues, the field must extend beyond scientific formalism to embrace a broader spectrum of cultural and musical meaning. 

A foundational concept introduced by Gresham-Lancaster is the distinction between first-order and second-order sonification. First-order sonification typically involves straightforward mapping of data points to sound parameters—e.g., a numerical value controlling oscillator frequency or filter cutoff. This direct translation preserves the integrity of the data but may lack emotional resonance or contextual clarity for listeners unfamiliar with the dataset or mappings. Second-order sonification introduces a higher level of abstraction. Here, data is not merely converted to sound but is used to control compositional structures such as rhythm, harmony, timbre, and formal development. This could manifest through software designs that incorporate statistical analysis of datasets to determine musical motifs or drive stochastic processes that evolve over time. By embedding data within culturally familiar or stylistically resonant frameworks—be it ambient textures, rhythmic patterns, or harmonic progressions allows the sonification to become more legible and emotionally impactful.

A key insight is that listeners inevitably interpret sound within a cultural and stylistic frame. Whether intentional or not, sonification software maps data to sonic outputs will be perceived through the lens of genre conventions—ambient, noise, glitch, minimalism, etc. This reinforces the necessity for designers of sonification systems to consciously engage with aesthetic decisions. Rather than viewing these as distractions from scientific rigor, they should be recognized as essential design variables that determine how well the sonification communicates. For instance, layering the sonified stream within an evolving drone texture or embedding it in rhythmic pulses tied to diurnal cycles may enhance the intelligibility of subtle shifts. These choices, while extramusical, profoundly affect the user's ability to detect and interpret meaningful changes.

The expressive capacity of sonification technics invites an analogy with sculpture, as cited in Xenakis’ conception of raw mathematical outputs as "virtual stones" to be artistically shaped. The creative coder similarly refines the raw outputs of data-driven patches, sculpting auditory forms through iterative experimentation, parameter tuning, and aesthetic discernment. This process reveals sonification not as a deterministic output of data, but as a collaboration between the structure of information and the intuition of the artist-programmer. Moreover, by incorporating techniques such as timbral mapping, adaptive filtering, and data-driven granular synthesis, it becomes a laboratory for crafting sonic experiences that honor both the source data and the listener’s perceptual world. This is particularly effective when the goal is to embed sonification within broader artistic or performative contexts—installations, interactive systems, or generative concerts—where expressivity and audience engagement are critical.

The evolution of sonification within the creative coding domain demands a reconceptualization of what constitutes success in sonification. Beyond reproducibility, the true measure lies in perceptual clarity, aesthetic engagement, and communicative power. As Gresham-Lancaster asserts, the inclusion of musical form, stylistic awareness, and cultural embedding are not luxuries, but necessities for sonification to become a widely adopted and meaningful practice Pure Data, with its flexibility, open-ended structure, and visual coding paradigm, provides an ideal environment to develop and test both first-order and second-order sonification systems. By embracing both scientific precision and artistic insight, Pd-based sonification becomes a model for interdisciplinary practice—where the auditory exploration of data is not just informative but transformative.


### Data Humanism: A Visual Manifesto of Giorgia Lupi

![Humanism of Data](/assets/images/sonification/datahumanism.jpeg)

Data is now recognized as one of the foundational pillars of our economy, and the idea that the world is exponentially enriched with data every day has long ceased to be news.

Big Data is no longer a distant dystopian future; it is a commodity and an intrinsic, iconic feature of our present—alongside dollars, concrete, automobiles, and Helvetica. The ways we relate to data are evolving faster than we realize, and our minds and bodies are naturally adapting to this new hybrid reality built from physical and informational structures. Visual design, with its unique power to reach deep into our subconscious instantly—bypassing language—and its inherent ability to convey vast amounts of structured and unstructured information across cultures, will play an even more central role in this quiet yet inevitable revolution.

Pioneers of data visualization like William Playfair, John Snow, Florence Nightingale, and Charles Joseph Minard were the first to harness and codify this potential in the 18th and 19th centuries. Modern advocates such as Edward Tufte, Ben Shneiderman, Jeffrey Heer, and Alberto Cairo have been instrumental in the field’s renaissance over the past twenty years, supporting the transition of these principles into the world of Big Data. 

Thanks to this renewed interest, an initial wave of data visualization swept across the web, reaching a wider audience beyond the academic circles where it had previously been confined. Unfortunately, this wave was often ridden superficially—used as a linguistic shortcut to cope with the overwhelming nature of Big Data.

“Cool” infographics promised a key to mastering this untamable complexity. When they inevitably failed to deliver on this overly optimistic expectation, we were left with gigabytes of illegible 3D pie charts and cheap, translucent user interfaces cluttered with widgets that even Tony Stark or John Anderton from *Minority Report* would struggle to understand.

In reality, visual design is often applied to data merely as a cosmetic gloss over serious and complicated problems—an attempt to make them appear simpler than they truly are. What made cheap marketing infographics so popular is perhaps their greatest contradiction: the false claim that a few pictograms and large numbers inherently have the power to “simplify complexity.” The phenomena that govern our world are, by definition, complex, multifaceted, and often difficult to grasp. So why would anyone want to dumb them down when making critical decisions or delivering important messages?

Yet, not all is bleak in this sudden craze for data visualization. We are becoming increasingly aware that there remains a considerable gap between the real potential hidden within vast datasets and the superficial images we typically use to represent them. More importantly, we now recognize that the first wave succeeded in familiarizing a broader audience with new visual languages and tools.

Having moved past what we might call the peak of infographics, we are left with a general audience equipped with some of the necessary skills to welcome a second wave of more meaningful, thoughtful visualization.

We are ready to question the impersonality of a purely technical approach to data and begin designing ways to connect numbers with what they truly represent: knowledge, behaviors, and people.

Certainly. Here's a refined and academically styled rephrasing of the provided section, maintaining clarity, structure, and alignment with the tone of an academic book:

## Data Humanism and Personal Data

**Data Humanism** is a perspective initially articulated by Giorgia Lupi [@lupi2017], grounded in the belief that meaningful engagement with data necessitates attention to its underlying contexts and the inclusion of subjective perspectives throughout the processes of data collection, analysis, and representation—particularly when the data reflects human experience. Rather than reducing information to mere numbers or abstractions, Data Humanism emphasizes the value of **personalized, context-rich, and narratively driven** interpretations. It advocates for a relationship with data that is not only analytical but also emotional, aesthetic, and reflective [@canossa2022].

This orientation has gained considerable traction within the domains of **personal informatics** and **personal visualization**, which investigate how individual-centered representations—visual or tangible—can support self-awareness, reflective thinking, and behavior change. Within these fields, Data Humanism has informed two primary dimensions: **data representation** and the **sensemaking process**.

### Data Representation

From the perspective of Data Humanism, effective data representation involves the creation of **complex and personalized visual forms**. “Complexity” here does not imply obfuscation, but rather a deliberate move beyond conventional charts and graphs, toward expressive visual metaphors capable of revealing unexpected connections and enriching the narrative potential of the data [@kim2019].

Personalization plays a crucial role in enabling individuals to **define and structure data** in accordance with their own conceptual frameworks, thus making the resulting representations more relevant and resonant. Moreover, contextual information—embedded at all stages of the data pipeline from collection to display—is essential for constructing **coherent and situated personal narratives**. This approach aligns with broader discourses in data visualization research that call for **expressive and nuanced visual forms**, capable of communicating layered meanings rather than merely delivering rapid information.

### Sensemaking Process

Data Humanism also foregrounds the importance of **deep, deliberate engagement** in the interpretive act of making sense of data. As Lupi [@lupi2017] observes, insight does not emerge from superficial scanning but from a sustained exploration of context and meaning. In this light, the process of data sensemaking is framed as **investigative, interpretive, and relational**, acknowledging the imperfection and approximation that are often intrinsic to human data.

This approach encourages individuals to **participate actively** in the shaping of their own data narratives—through exploration, translation, and imaginative visualization—which in turn facilitates deeper personal connections and empathetic understanding of others. These practices resonate with the concept of **slow technology** [@hallnas2001], which posits that slower, more reflective interactions can enrich user experience, enabling more space for contemplation and insight. Here, “slowness” is not a limitation but a strategic feature, fostering sustained attention and interpretive depth.

Recent work in personal visualization has explored how Data Humanism can be applied in practice. One avenue involves **sketch-based visualization tools**, which leverage the intuitive, open-ended nature of drawing to support the creation of personalized visual representations. Another involves **constructive visualizations**: physical, often non-digital artifacts that users assemble and manipulate to give form to data. Additionally, digital platforms have been developed that enable the design of expressive visualizations capable of capturing **qualitative aspects of personal context**, broadening the expressive range of data visual design.

Overall, Data Humanism advocates for data representations that embrace **subjectivity and slowness** as virtues rather than limitations. It proposes that personal data is best understood not through abstract generalization, but through thoughtful, expressive, and often collaborative processes. In this book, we extend this line of inquiry by examining how **Data Humanism principles can be integrated into collaborative design practices** for personal visualization—exploring new ways to humanize, materialize, and narrativize the data that defines and reflects our lives.

## Electrocardiogram Data  

This Pure Data patch represents an innovative approach to biomedical data sonification, transforming electrocardiogram (ECG) readings into audible waveforms. By treating physiological data as audio samples, the patch creates a unique intersection between medical diagnostics and sound synthesis, offering both artistic and analytical possibilities for exploring cardiac rhythms through auditory perception.

| `readtxt` | Subpatch for file analysis | Counts data points in text file |
| `textfile` | File reading mechanism | Loads ECG data from external source |
| `table/array` | Data storage buffer | Holds ECG samples for playback |
| `phasor~` | Playback control oscillator | Sweeps through array data |
| `tabread4~` | Audio sample interpolator | Reads array as continuous audio |
| `freeverb~` | Spatial audio processor | Adds reverberation to output |


### ECG Data Format and Structure

The electrocardiogram.txt file contains preprocessed electrocardiogram (ECG) data representing cardiac electrical activity captured from a real patient or medical recording device.

#### Format Specification
- **File Type**: Plain text format (.txt)
- **Data Points**: 47,499 individual samples
- **Value Range**: Approximately 544 to 1,023 
- **Sampling Structure**: One numerical value per line

The high sample count (47,499 points) provides sufficient temporal resolution to capture multiple complete heartbeat cycles, enabling both detailed analysis of individual cardiac events and broader rhythm pattern recognition through auditory display techniques.

### Data Flow

The `readtxt` subpatch serves as a preprocessing module that:

1. Opens the electrocardiogram.txt file
2. Counts the total number of data points
3. Calculates appropriate array dimensions
4. Provides sizing information for memory allocation

```{mermaid}

```

The electrocardiogram sonification patch orchestrates a sophisticated data transformation pipeline that converts static physiological measurements into dynamic audio experiences. This process involves multiple interconnected stages of data handling, each contributing essential functionality to the overall system's ability to render cardiac rhythms as meaningful sonic representations.

The initial phase of data flow centers on the comprehensive analysis and preparation of the source electrocardiogram dataset. The `readtxt` subpatch performs a preliminary scan of the `electrocardiogram.txt` file, systematically counting the total number of individual data points contained within the text document. This preprocessing step proves crucial for subsequent memory allocation decisions, as Pure Data requires explicit array dimensioning before data can be loaded into memory buffers. The subpatch communicates the determined data quantity to the main patch, enabling dynamic array sizing that accommodates datasets of varying lengths without requiring manual configuration adjustments. Following this analysis phase, the system initiates the actual data transfer process, where numerical values representing cardiac electrical activity are systematically loaded from the text file into Pure Data's internal array structures. This loading operation transforms the static file-based data into a format suitable for real-time audio processing, creating a bridge between stored physiological measurements and live sonic synthesis.

The audio synthesis stage represents the core transformation where biological data becomes audible waveform. The `phasor~` object generates a continuous ramp signal that serves as the fundamental timing mechanism for array traversal, essentially functioning as a playback head that moves through the stored ECG data at a controllable rate. This oscillator's frequency parameter directly determines the speed at which the cardiac data is sonified, allowing for temporal scaling that can compress hours of ECG recordings into minutes of audio or extend brief cardiac events for detailed auditory analysis. The `tabread4~` object performs the critical function of converting discrete array values into continuous audio signals through sophisticated interpolation algorithms. Rather than simply stepping through individual data points, which would produce harsh discontinuities and aliasing artifacts, the four-point interpolation scheme creates smooth transitions between adjacent values, resulting in audio output that maintains the natural flow characteristics of the original cardiac rhythms while remaining suitable for human auditory perception.

The final processing stage introduces spatial and timbral enhancements that transform the raw sonified data into aesthetically coherent audio suitable for both analytical and artistic applications. The `freeverb~` object applies algorithmic reverberation that adds spatial depth and acoustic warmth. This reverberation processing serves multiple purposes: it masks potential digital artifacts from the sonification process, creates a more immersive listening environment that encourages extended auditory analysis, and provides timbral coherence that helps listeners focus on meaningful patterns rather than being distracted by the mechanical quality of direct data-to-audio conversion. The spatial processing also contributes to the patch's potential for integration into larger sonic environments, where the ECG sonification might coexist with other audio elements in installations or performance contexts.

Throughout this entire data flow pathway, the system maintains precise temporal relationships between the original cardiac measurements and their auditory representations, ensuring that the sonification preserves the essential rhythmic and morphological characteristics that define cardiac health and pathology. This fidelity to source data temporal structure enables the sonification to serve legitimate diagnostic and educational purposes while simultaneously opening creative possibilities for artistic exploration of physiological processes.

```{mermaid}

```
The patch maintains signal integrity through:

- 4-point interpolation for anti-aliasing
- Configurable playback rates for temporal scaling
- Reverb processing for spatial contextualization

This electrocardiogram synthesis patch demonstrates Pure Data's versatility in scientific data visualization through sound, creating meaningful auditory representations of biological processes while maintaining the temporal and amplitude characteristics essential for medical interpretation.


## ECG-Controlled Step Sequencer

This patch demonstrates an innovative approach to data-driven rhythm generation, where electrocardiogram readings function as temporal control signals for a step sequencer. By interpreting cardiac rhythm data as beat timing information, the patch creates a unique hybrid system that transforms physiological patterns into musical sequences, establishing a direct relationship between biological rhythms and electronic music production.

![Fig. ](/assets/screenshots/sonification/electrocardiogram-stepseq.png)

### Patch Overview

The ECG-controlled step sequencer implements a rhythm generation system that uses cardiac data as the fundamental timing source for audio playback. Rather than sonifying the ECG waveform directly, this patch extracts temporal information from the physiological data to control the rhythmic structure of a step sequencer, creating polyrhythmic patterns that reflect the natural variability of human heartbeat intervals.

| `soundfiler` | Audio file loader | Loads external audio into array |
| `spigot` | Gate control | Enables/disables sequencer operation |

#### Data Processing Components

**ReadTxt Subpatch**

The `readtxt` subpatch functions as the primary data interface, managing both file loading and data quantification:

- Opens and reads the electrocardiogram.txt file
- Counts total data points for array sizing
- Loads data into local table for sequential access
- Provides file path management and error handling

**Counter Subpatch**

The counter mechanism implements sequential data traversal with automatic cycling:

- Maintains current position in ECG dataset
- Increments through data points on each trigger
- Resets to beginning when reaching data endpoint
- Provides configurable upper limits for partial data playback

### Data Flow

The ECG-controlled step sequencer orchestrates a multi-stage data transformation process that converts static cardiac measurements into dynamic rhythmic triggers. This system demonstrates how biological timing patterns can be extracted and repurposed as musical control data, creating compositions that maintain organic temporal characteristics while serving structured musical functions.

The initial data preparation phase centers on the comprehensive loading and organization of the electrocardiogram dataset. The `readtxt` subpatch performs dual functions: it analyzes the text file structure to determine data quantity and simultaneously loads the numerical values into Pure Data's table system for efficient random access. This preprocessing ensures that the cardiac data becomes immediately available for real-time sequential reading without file system delays that would disrupt musical timing. The subpatch communicates essential metadata to the main patch, including total data point count and successful loading confirmation, enabling the counter system to establish appropriate cycling boundaries for continuous operation.

The rhythmic control generation stage represents the core innovation where cardiac data becomes musical timing information. The `counter` subpatch maintains a position index that advances through the ECG dataset on each bang trigger, creating a sequential reading mechanism that treats the physiological data as a tempo map. Each ECG value retrieved through `tabread` undergoes scaling multiplication to convert the raw cardiac measurement into a meaningful delay time for the `del` object. This scaling factor determines the relationship between cardiac electrical activity levels and musical tempo, allowing for both literal interpretations where higher cardiac values produce faster rhythms, or inverted mappings where increased cardiac activity corresponds to longer inter-beat intervals, mimicking cardiac refractory periods.

The audio playback coordination stage transforms the ECG-derived timing signals into actual sound events through sophisticated sample triggering mechanisms. Each bang generated by the delay object initiates playback of audio material stored in the `audiotable` array via the `tabplay~` object. The `soundfiler` object ensures that external audio files are properly loaded and resized within the array structure, while the `spigot` gate provides manual control over the sequencer's operational state. This architecture enables the system to function as a complete musical instrument where the natural variability of cardiac rhythms generates complex polyrhythmic patterns that would be difficult to achieve through conventional programmed sequencing methods.

### Processing Chain Details

The patch maintains sonic coherence through several design considerations: the scaling factor allows adjustment of the overall tempo range to match musical contexts, the counter's cycling behavior ensures continuous operation without interruption, and the audio loading system supports various sample types from percussive hits to sustained tones. This flexibility enables the ECG step sequencer to function across diverse sound applications, from experimental compositions exploring biological rhythms to dance music productions requiring organic timing variations.
